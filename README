NAME
    Date::Lectionary::Time - Find your way in time relative to Sundays.

VERSION
    Version 1.20180422.1

SYNOPSIS
    Working in the liturgical time of the lectionary means tracking time
    relative to Sundays. This is a quick utility to find the next, previous,
    or the closest Sunday to a given date. Further, it can determine if the
    date given is a Sunday or not.

        use Time::Piece;
        use Date::Lectionary::Time qw(nextSunday prevSunday closestSunday isSunday);

        my $christmasDay = Time::Piece->strptime("2015-12-25", "%Y-%m-%d");

        if (isSunday($christmasDay)) {
            say "Christmas is on a Sunday!";
        }
        else {
            say "Christmas isn't on a Sunday.";
        }

        my $sundayAfterChristmas = nextSunday($christmasDay);
        my $sundayBeforeChristmas = prevSunday($christmasDay);
        my $sundayClosestToChristmas = closestSunday($christmasDay);
