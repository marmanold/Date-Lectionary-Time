=head1 NAME

Date::Lectionary::Time - Find your way in time relative to Sundays.

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.20180422

use version; our $VERSION = version->declare("v1.20180422");

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Working in the liturgical time of the lectionary means tracking time relative to Sundays.  This is a quick utility to find the next, previous, or the closest Sunday to a given date.  Further, it can determine if the date given is a Sunday or not.

    use Time::Piece;
    use Date::Lectionary::Time qw(nextSunday prevSunday closestSunday isSunday);

    my $christmasDay = Time::Piece->strptime("2015-12-25", "%Y-%m-%d");

    if (isSunday($christmasDay)) {
        say "Christmas is on a Sunday!";
    }
    else {
        say "Christmas isn't on a Sunday.";
    }

    my $sundayAfterChristmas = nextSunday($christmasDay);
    my $sundayBeforeChristmas = prevSunday($christmasDay);
    my $sundayClosestToChristmas = closestSunday($christmasDay);

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 nextSunday

For a given Time::Piece date returns a Time::Piece object of the date of the Sunday immediately following the given date.

=head2 prevSunday

For a given Time::Piece date returns a Time::Piece object of the date of the Sunday immediately before the given date.

=head2 closestSunday

For a given Time::Piece date returns a Time::Piece object of the date of the Sunday closest to the given date.
